# Vue Technical Test

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js (v20 minimum)**: You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

To check your current version of Node.js, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If your version is lower than v20, please update to a newer version.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Once you have Node.js v20 or higher, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the local development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified in your configuration).

### 3. Accessing the Application

Open your web browser and go to the provided URL to view your application.

## Additional Notes

- If you encounter any issues with the installation, please ensure your Node.js version meets the minimum requirement (v20).
